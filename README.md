# Challenge-17

## Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to use a variety of machine learning methods in order to assess the credit risk of potential credit card holders and determine which method is the most effective.

## Summary

The best of the tried methods in this particular project would be the Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier. It has the highest balanced accuracy, recall and preciscion percentages. Second place for all percentages would go to the Balanced Random Forest Classifier. The Naive, SMOTE and SMOTEENN methods all had roughly the same scores while the Undersampling method had the lowest percentages.
